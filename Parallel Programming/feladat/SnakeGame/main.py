# Description:
# This program is a Snake game which uses multithreading using the library threading.
# The game saves high scores to a file.
# Two threads are being used: one for rendering the screen, and one for handling the keyboard inputs.
# The game is played by pressing the arrow keys.
# The game can be paused by clicking the X button in the top right corner of the window.
